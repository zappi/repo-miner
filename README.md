###  Code churn analyzer

Analyze and classify relative code churn, to indicate how much a file changes relative to its size, over time.
By capturing the frequency of changes (lines added, deleted, or modified) as a ratio to each fileâ€™s total lines of code, this approach offers a way to assess the stability of different parts of the codebase.
Files with high relative churn may indicate areas of potential instability, signaling higher volatility due to frequent adjustments or fixes.
